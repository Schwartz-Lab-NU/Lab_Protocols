# Yoda 1 Allicuots preparation
Yoda1 is a piezo1 channel agonist/sensitizer. 

The vial comes in a 10mg powder. We want to use it at 20 μM concentration in 500mL of Ames (that means 10  μmols in 500mL). 

1. Dissolve powder into 1.41 mL of DMSO
2. Divide in vials
    - 3 x 450  μL
    - Each vial will have a concentration o 20 mM

3. Dissolve into 450 mL of Ames
     - The resulting concentration will be 20  μM.
