# Rig Set up
The purpose of these instructions is to be a fast checklist of everything that needs to be done to set up the rig before dissection. 

- Raph made a fantastic and detailed guide that can be found and downloaded [here](images/RigSetUp.pdf)  for a more comprehensive explanation. 


## 0. Turn on the rig
Begin with turning on the four power strips. 
Turn on the monitors if they arenâ€™t on automatically.

## 1. Perfusion
**Grab:** ames bottle, bubblers (x2) and their adaptors, tap with 4 holes, dissection bottle. 
- Turn on heaters and fill them with tap water (2L)
- Ames 2L bottle:
    - Take out 250cc for dissection
    - Set up lines:
        - Insert **in line** in Ames bottle
        - Run Ames into the bath for 2-3min
        - Insert **out line** in Ames bottle
## 2. Microscope
- Open lin lab
- Turn on lamp
- Open multiclamp and symphony
- Focus bottom of the dish at 10x, then at 60x. 
    - Set Z at 0 
- Focus condenser
    - Turn the knob in the lower end of the scope until you see the condenser aperture. 
    - Switch from objective to condenser
    - Focus in **Z** and Set **C** at 0 
- *Allignment cross:* focused at the bottom of the dish!
    - In symphony, open the Allignment cross stimuli
    - Turn off the lamp
    - Change filter (NDF) to 0 or 1, if needed
        
             *In rig B:* allignment cross is of around -40 to -50 uM in the condenser. If you focus it there, is going to look sharper. 
## 3. Electrode 
- Base position: 
    - Set 10x objective at 7000 uM
    - Put the electrode in and find it.
    - Set everything to 0
    - Change the objective to 60x
    - Focus the electrode and Set everything to 0 again. 
    - Go to 3000 on Z and focus the electrode. Set that as home in. Turn into *approach mode* and go to 0 or positive in **Z**. Set  that position as **home out**. 


## 4. Software
- Lin lab: electrodes
- Multiclamp: amplifier
    - Reset default
    - Standard configuration
    - Check system noise 
        - Should be less than 10. 
- Symphony: allignment cross.
    - Focus bottom of the dish at 10x, then at 60x, then do the allignment cross. 
    - Focus condenser. 


### Caution: Before dissecting: check the perfussion. It's always the first and most fatal source of errors.
