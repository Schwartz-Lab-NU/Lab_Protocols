# Immunohistochemistry 
### For wholemount retina

    Kudos to Julia and Devon who showed me all the steps

## 0. Fix with PFA
**CAUTION** PFA tools and disposal use different containers. 
Evertyhting is done in the hood. 

Ingredients: 4% PFA and 12 wells. Around 500 uL per well.
- Pipette PFA in wells. 
    - 15 min for the dissected retina
    - 30-45min for whole eye. 
- Wash 3 times with PBS, 5 min apart. After 3rd wash, leave the samples in the fridge (not freezer) covered with parafilm or proceed with IHC. 
## 1. Permeabilization
-  4 hours at room temperature with **0.5% Triton X** (diluted in PBS)
## 2. Blocking solution
Over night at room temperature (and shaking?) with: 
- 3% NDS + 0.5% triton X
    
    *or*
- 3% BSA + 0.5% triton X


## 3. Primary antibody
The antibodies are in the white freezer. Write down from which animal is the primary and make sure there is a compatible secondary. 

- In an eppendorf tube, pour 1.5mL of blocking solution and 30 uL (or 50, the idea is having a 3-5% preparation) of the primary antibody. --> **antibody + blocking buffer solution**
- Wash the blocking solution 3 times  (20min apart) 
- Pipette the primary antibody in the retina. And incubate itfor:
    - 48 hours at room temperature
    - 5 days at 4 degrees C. 

## 4. Secondary antibody 
**Use the black eppendorf**
- Wash the primary antibody, 3 times, 20min apart.
- Incubate the secondary antibody **overnight** at room temperature in blocking buffer.
