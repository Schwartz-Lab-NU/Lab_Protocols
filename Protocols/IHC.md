### For wholemount retina

    Kudos to Julia and Devon who showed me all the steps

## 0. Fix with PFA
**CAUTION** PFA tools and disposal use different containers. 
Evertyhting is done in the hood. 

Ingredients: 4% PFA and 12 wells. Around 500 uL per well.
- Pipette PFA in wells. 
    - 15 min for the dissected retina
    - 30-45min for whole eye with the cornea pierced.

- Wash 3 times with PBS, 5 min apart. After 3rd wash, leave the samples in the fridge (not freezer) covered with parafilm or proceed with IHC. 

All the subsequent steps are done in on a plate shaker.
## 1. Permeabilization
-  4 hours at room temperature with **0.5% Triton X** (diluted in PBS)
## 2. Blocking solution

Over night at room temperature with: 
- 3% NDS + 0.5% triton X
    
    *or*
- 3% BSA + 0.5% triton X


## 3. Primary antibody
The antibodies are in the white freezer. Write down from which animal is the primary and make sure there is a compatible secondary. 

- In an eppendorf tube, pour 1.5mL of blocking solution and 5 uL of the allicuoted primary antibody (1:500) --> **antibody + blocking buffer solution**
- Pipette the primary antibody in the retina. And incubate for:
    - 48 hours at room temperature
    - 5 days at 4 degrees C. 

- Wash 3 times with PBS (20min apart) at room temperature.

## 4. Secondary antibody 
**Use the black eppendorf**
- anti-*PrimaryAB (i.e Goat)*- *desired fluorophore* diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. 
- Add DAPI with secondaries if you want to use it 1:500. 
- Incubate the secondary antibody for **24h** at room temperature in blocking buffer. 
- Wash 3 times with PBS (20min apart) at room temperature. 
- Mount with Fluoromont and proceed to imaging.
