# Immunohistochemistry 
### For wholemount retina

    Kudos to Julia and Devon who showed me all the steps

## 0. Fix with PFA
**CAUTION** PFA tools and disposal use different containers. 
Evertyhting is done in the hood. 

Ingredients: 4% PFA and 12 wells. Around 500 uL per well.
- Pipette PFA in wells. 
    - 15 min for the dissected retina
    - 30-45min for whole eye. 
- Wash 3 times with PBS, 5 min apart. After 3rd wash, leave the samples in the fridge (not freezer) covered with parafilm or proceed with IHC. 
## 1. Permeabilization
-  4 hours at room temperature with **0.5% Triton X** (diluted in PBS)
## 2. Blocking solution
Over night at room temperature (and shaking?) with: 
- 3% NDS + 0.5% triton X
    
    *or*
- 3% BSA + 0.5% triton X
- Wash with PBS 20min 

## 3. Primary antibody
The antibodies are in the white freezer. Write down from which animal is the primary and make sure there is a compatible secondary. 

- In an eppendorf tube, pour 1.5mL of blocking solution and 30 uL (or 50, the idea is having a 3-5% preparation) of the primary antibody. --> **antibody + blocking buffer solution**
- Wash the blocking solution 3 times  (20min apart) 
- Pipette the primary antibody in the retina. And incubate itfor:
    - 48 hours at room temperature
    - 5 days at 4 degrees C. 

## 4. Secondary antibody 
**Use the black eppendorf**
- Wash the primary antibody, 3 times, 20min apart.
- Incubate the secondary antibody **overnight** at room temperature in blocking buffer. 
 

## 5. Mount the Retina
- Wash 3 times with PBS, 20min apart. 
- **Materials:**
    - Slides with tape
    - Mounting media
    - Nail polish
    - Poly- D disc
    - 1 mL pipette (break the tip)

1. Pipette some mounting media and take out bubbles.
2. Put a small drop in the slide. 
4. Put poly-D disc. 
5. Put retina in with the pippete
6. Dry it using kim wipes and flatten it with forces (or wet kim wiepe). 
7. Put mounting media on the side and put coverslip. Make sure there are no bubbles. 
8. If using Diamond anti fade mounting media, always use nail polish. 
    - If using vectorshiled mounting media, use nail polish or wait 12-24h for the media to cure.
