# Checklist before recording

## Coordinates and condenser focus
1. Inspect the whole retina on 10x
2. Find the ventral (biggest) cut and go up
3. Find the optic nerve and set XY coordinates to 0. **Not Z!**
4. Look for a flat area and anotate the XY coordinates
5. Focus on the photorreceptors. 
6. Get out of the retina and focus the condenser again on the photorreceptors height and set C to 0 again. 
    1. In B, after setting C to zero, focus C to the coordinate you previously registered. 
7. You are ready to record now. 

## Tearing the inner limiting membrane
8. Put the electrode in, set autolock, lock in positive pressure (~2)

## Open the DataSource
9.
