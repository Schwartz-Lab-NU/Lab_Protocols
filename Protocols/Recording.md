# Checklist before recording

0. Mark the mouse as deceased on AI
## Coordinates and condenser focus
1. Inspect the whole retina on 10x
2. Find the ventral (biggest) cut and go up
3. Find the optic nerve and set XY coordinates to 0. **Not Z!**
4. Look for a flat area and anotate the XY coordinates
5. Focus on the photorreceptors. 
6. Get out of the retina and focus the **condenser** on the photorreceptors height and set **C** to 0. 
    1. In B, after setting C to zero, focus C to the coordinate you previously registered. 
7. You are ready to record now. 

## Electrode in
8. Put the electrode in, and  lock in positive pressure (~1.3-1.4)
9. Set pippete offset (you should do this everytime a new pipette enters the solution).

10. Press home in. Move forward in X, then in Y and find the electrode. 

## Tearing the inner limiting membrane
Once you have identified a flat area susceptible to recording, you need peel off glial cells end feet (*inner limiting membrane*) with the pipette **without** hurting the ganglion cells.
